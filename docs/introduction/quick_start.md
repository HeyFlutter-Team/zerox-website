2. **Search for a Flutter Package:** 

    - After signing up, you'll be directed to the main page, where you can easily explore and manage Flutter packages. At the top, you'll find a simple search bar that lets you quickly find the exact package you need for your project, making the process faster and more efficient:

    - Simply type the package name or relevant keywords into the search bar, and the system will fetch results directly from pub.dev, showing a list of packages with their names, descriptions, and ratings, ensuring you have the most accurate and up-to-date information to choose the best package for your project.


    - Once you find the package you want, click on it to see a detailed overview, including:

        - **Usage Instructions:** Clear, step-by-step instructions on how to add the package to your project.
        - **Platform Compatibility:** Details on which platforms (iOS, Android, web, etc.) the package works with.
        - **Community Ratings and Reviews:** Feedback from other developers to help you assess the package's reliability and performance.

    With all this information, you’ll be ready to confidently integrate the package into your project and improve its functionality.

    - **Drag and Drop:** Simply drag and drop the project folder into the upload area.
    - **Choose Folder:** Click **Choose Folder** to manually browse your system and select the project folder.
    - **Use Recent Projects:** Quickly access previously opened projects by selecting one from the **Recent Projects** list.
    - **Import from an IDE:** Easily import your projects directly from your development environment. To select your preferred IDE—whether it's **VS Code**, **Android Studio**, or **IntelliJ**—simply click the settings icon for quick setup.

    **Note**: Ensure your selected project is properly configured before adding the package to avoid any issues during the integration process.

4. **Select Your Device:** Select the device or platform where you'd like to test the package integration. Based on your project needs, you can choose from the following options:

    - **Browser**: Test the package in a live web environment using popular browsers like Chrome, Safari, Edge, and more.
    - **Windows**: Select this option to test the package integration on a Windows desktop application, ensuring compatibility and functionality on the platform.
    - **macOS**: If you're on macOS, select this option to test the package on a macOS desktop application.
    - **Linux**: For Linux users, choose this option to test the integration on a Linux desktop applicatio
    - **Real Devices**: Select a physical iOS or Android device to test the package on a real device.
    - **Emulator/Simulator**: Select an emulator or simulator to test the package on a virtual device, providing a faster and more efficient way to test and debug.

    This step ensures the package is tested in the right environment, helping you confirm its functionality and compatibility across various platforms.

5. **Check Pre-requirements:** Before implementing any package, you might be asked to provide some necessary details. For example, if you’re adding an **Authentication** package, we’ll need to know what fields you want on the Sign-Up and Sign-In pages, such as name, email, password, and any other details you need from users. This helps make sure the package fits your project correctly. If there are any other specific details required for the package, you’ll be asked to provide them before moving forward."

6. **Generate the Package:** Once you've entered all the required details, simply click the **Generate** button. From that moment, ZeroX takes care of the rest. We'll automatically add the package to your Flutter project, update the `pubspec.yaml` file, generate the necessary code with AI, and integrate it seamlessly into your project.

    When you run your project, the package will already be integrated and fully functional—no additional steps are needed from your side.
