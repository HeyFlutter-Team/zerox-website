2. **Search for a Flutter Package:** 

    - After signing up, you'll be directed to the main page, where you can easily explore and manage Flutter packages. At the top, you'll find a simple search bar that lets you quickly find the exact package you need for your project, making the process faster and more efficient:

    - Simply type the package name or relevant keywords into the search bar, and the system will fetch results directly from pub.dev, showing a list of packages with their names, descriptions, and ratings, ensuring you have the most accurate and up-to-date information to choose the best package for your project.


    - Once you find the package you want, click on it to see a detailed overview, including:

        - **Usage Instructions:** Clear, step-by-step instructions on how to add the package to your project.
        - **Platform Compatibility:** Details on which platforms (iOS, Android, web, etc.) the package works with.
        - **Community Ratings and Reviews:** Feedback from other developers to help you assess the package's reliability and performance.

**Note**: Ensure your selected project is properly configured before adding the package to avoid any issues during the integration process.

4. **Select Your Device:** Pick the platform where you want to test the package integration. You can choose from these options:

    - **Browser**: Run live tests directly in web browsers like Chrome, Safari, Edge, and more.
    - **Real Devices**: Use an actual iOS or Android device to test in a real-world scenario.
    - **Emulator/Simulator**: Test on a virtual device—use an emulator for Android or a simulator for iOS—for quick and efficient debugging.

    This step helps you validate the package's functionality and compatibility across different environments.
