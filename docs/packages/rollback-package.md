# Rollback Package

If a package causes issues or is incompatible, you can perform a rollback to a previous stable version. This step ensures that your project remains functional while troubleshooting any issues introduced by recent package updates.

### **Immediate Rollback**

When a package is successfully integrated, you can quickly roll it back if needed.

1.  After the package integration completes, locate the **Rollback** button on the **Package Integration Successful** page.
2.  Click the **Rollback** button to revert the changes immediately.

2.  Follow the prompts to complete the re-integration.
